# Nevermore Micro V6

Nevermore Micro V6 is here! It is designed to supersede both the V4 and V5 duos, which will soon be considered legacy designs.

## What's New?

- **Intact 5015 Fans:** V6 now make use of fully intact 5015 fans, eliminating the need to cut the fan scroll or wires. This raises a concern: does it waste carbon if airflow from a small 15mm 5015 fan exhaust isn't spread over the entire 130mm filter surface? Yes, usually - however, we have overcome this challenge through use of evasees and vanes to efficiently spread the airflow within the small plenum space. This means all the carbon receives airflow immediately, without requiring any fan modifications.

- **Enhanced Heat Tolerance:** Unlike its predecessors, V6 can tolerate higher levels of heat. The V4 and V5 had thinner lids that could bend or warp, especially when subjected to temperatures above 100Â°C under a heated bed. This sometimes resulted in broken or damaged units. However, the V6 is beefed up to address this issue. With a thicker frame, structured vanes, and lids strategically placed away from the heat source, the chances of melting a Nevermore Micro are significantly reduced.

- **Improved Airflow:** V6 boasts superior airflow. We have achieved this by optimizing the printing direction, which allows for built-in seals. Say goodbye to air leaks between the cartridge and the plenum! Furthermore, the air intakes have been redesigned to accommodate increased airflow. Now, it can process the chamber volume of a 250 Voron in just 30 seconds, and a larger 350 in approximately 2 minutes.

- **Reduced Noise:** V6 generates less noise compared to the V5, thanks to a redesigned air intake.

- **Compatibility:** V6 can be printed on any machine, including on a Voron v0 on which a v5 duo previously wouldnt fit. Yet the size is the same, its dark sorcery.

- **Sleek Design:** V6 not only performs exceptionally but also looks awesome. It features a novel jalousie lid design with no bolts, allowing for convenient one-handed carbon swaps. Gone are the days of dealing with annoying bolts or latches when swapping carbon. Rest assured, this design remains super secure. You have to try it to believe it!
